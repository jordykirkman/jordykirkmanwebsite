  <h3>Manifesto</h3>
  <p>
Society thinks being ambitious and a gamer are mutually exclusive. My life proves that wrong. As a proud member of one of the most diverse communities ever, I push for us to be inclusive, accepting, and fun loving. I never start a game without a “Good luck” and never end one without a “Good game”.

Gaming is about fun, not just about winning, because the people we play with are more than just opponents. The community is where we share experiences, art, and storytelling, and we do it in a way that nothing else can. Gaming is the social and entertainment platform of the future, and contrary to stereotypes I know it has the potential to become a true force for social good. Gl hf.
