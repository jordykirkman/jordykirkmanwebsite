  <h3>Manifesto</h3>
  <p>
It seems to me that much of society thinks being ambitious and a gamer are mutually exclusive. My life proves they are not. As a member of surely one of the most diverse communities ever, I push for us to be inclusive, accepting and fun loving. Never start a game without a “Good luck”. Never end a game without a “Good game”. We need to understand that other people are there to have fun; not to aide in our entertainment. I think gaming is the social and entertainment platform of the future. But more than that, its a platform for sharing experiences, art and storytelling like nothing else. Its more immersive and interactive than television, film or sports. And contrary to popular stereotypes, I know it is at least as social. Gl hf.

I have done my best to make this website work how I think all websites should. You may notice content is lazy loaded as you scroll. Why waste the bandwidth if you never scroll down? I hope you enjoy your stay here. This site is built with Ember.js. Here is the repository: <a href="https://github.com/jordykirkman/embersite" target="_blank">github.com/jordykirkman/embersite</a>
