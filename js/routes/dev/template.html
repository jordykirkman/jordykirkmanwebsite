      <h3>Apps I have built</h3>
      <p class="caption">Can you see the code? Ha! What, are you a corporate spy or something? My working contract doesn't allow such things. So here are some gifs of my projects with info blurred out. However, you can check out some of my personal project repositories here: <a href="https://github.com/jordykirkman" target="_blank">github.com/jordykirkman</a>. One repository is this website. The other two are for a recipe sharing app I am working on in Ember along with it's Node.js services.</p>

      <h3>Ongoing personal project: <a href="https://recipeboxapp.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Recipe sharing app</a></h3>
      <p>This is something I have been working on for a few months. The basic concept is that you can share a bank of recipes with friends, who can also contribute to the bank. There are many recipe sharing apps out there. What makes this unique is that there is no foux-facebook social experience required! My intention is for it to be as simple as possible. You can sign up for an account and try it out.</p>

      <h3>This is a graph rating some of my skills.</h3>
      <p class="caption">It's two Ember views. Each take in a list of values. One lists out the rating criteria and the other is for the bars. If I develop a new skill, I just add it to the list and the graph resizes accordingly. I've made a similar dynamic graph before using SVG.js and a single Ember view. I didnt think it was necessary for a simple bar graph to use svg. This could also be done with an Ember component for abstraction and reusability in a larger project.</p>
